The number of proposed metrics over the graph history is overwhelming. Over the years, scientists constantly introduce new metrics in order to measure speciﬁc features of speciﬁc graphs. Aiming for generality, this research will focus on the classiﬁcation of unweighted, undirected, general graph metrics.},

The shortest path ({SP}) problem involves the problem of finding a suitable path between “two vertices or nodes in a graph” in such a way that the sum of the weights of its component edges is minimal. There are many theories for solving this problem one of the widely used way solution for solving this problem is Dijkstra’s algorithm ({DA}) which is also widely used in many engineering calculation works also. There are two types of {DA} one is the basic one and other one is optimized. This paper is focused on the basics one which provides a shortest route between source node and the destination node. Main focus has been kept on keeping the work simple and easy to understand with some basic concepts .Storage space and operational efficiency improvement has been tried to improve.},

The attacker may want to minimize over subsets of edges the difference between (or the ratio of) the effort incurred and the benefit received. This idea leads to the definition of the “strength” of the network, a measure of the resistance of the network to such attacks. Efficient algorithms for the optimal attack problem, the problem of computing the strength, and the problem of finding a minimum cost “reinforcement” to achieve a desired strength are given. These problems are also solved for a different model, in which the attacker wants to separate vertices from a fixed central vertex.},

	abstract = {"Shimon Even's Graph Algorithms, published in 1979, was a seminal introductory book on algorithms read by everyone engaged in the field. This thoroughly revised second edition, with a foreword by Richard M. Karp and notes by Andrew V. Goldberg, continues the exceptional presentation from the first edition and explains algorithms in a formal but simple language with a direct and intuitive presentation. The book begins by covering basic material, including graphs and shortest paths, trees, depth-first-search, and breadth-first search. The main part of the book is devoted to network flows and applications of network flows, and it ends with chapters on planar graphs and testing graph planarity"--},
