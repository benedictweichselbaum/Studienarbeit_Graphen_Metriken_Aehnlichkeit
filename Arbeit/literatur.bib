The number of proposed metrics over the graph history is overwhelming. Over the years, scientists constantly introduce new metrics in order to measure speciﬁc features of speciﬁc graphs. Aiming for generality, this research will focus on the classiﬁcation of unweighted, undirected, general graph metrics.},

The shortest path ({SP}) problem involves the problem of finding a suitable path between “two vertices or nodes in a graph” in such a way that the sum of the weights of its component edges is minimal. There are many theories for solving this problem one of the widely used way solution for solving this problem is Dijkstra’s algorithm ({DA}) which is also widely used in many engineering calculation works also. There are two types of {DA} one is the basic one and other one is optimized. This paper is focused on the basics one which provides a shortest route between source node and the destination node. Main focus has been kept on keeping the work simple and easy to understand with some basic concepts .Storage space and operational efficiency improvement has been tried to improve.},

The attacker may want to minimize over subsets of edges the difference between (or the ratio of) the effort incurred and the benefit received. This idea leads to the definition of the “strength” of the network, a measure of the resistance of the network to such attacks. Efficient algorithms for the optimal attack problem, the problem of computing the strength, and the problem of finding a minimum cost “reinforcement” to achieve a desired strength are given. These problems are also solved for a different model, in which the attacker wants to separate vertices from a fixed central vertex.},

	abstract = {Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the “wrong” answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.},

The classic definition, proposed by Bavelas (1950), Beauchamp (1965), and Sabidussi (1966), is (the inverse of) the average distance to all other nodes.We propose the first highly scalable (near linear-time processing and linear space overhead) algorithm for estimating, within a small relative error, the classic closeness centralities of all nodes in the graph. Our algorithm applies to undirected graphs, as well as for centrality computed with respect to round-trip distances in directed graphs.For directed graphs, we also propose an efficient algorithm that approximates generalizations of classic closeness centrality to outbound and inbound centralities. Although it does not provide worst-case theoretical approximation guarantees, it is designed to perform well on real networks.We perform extensive experiments on large networks, demonstrating high scalability and accuracy.},

The independence number is most commonly denoted alpha(G), but may also be written beta(G) (e.g., Burger et al. 1997) or beta\_0(G) (e.g., Bollobás 1981).  The independence number of a graph is...},

Given a vertex cover of a graph, all vertices not in the cover define a independent vertex set (Skiena 1990, p. 218). A maximum independent vertex set is an independent vertex set containing the largest possible number of vertices for a given graph.

We also obtain improved algorithms for {MIS} in graphs with maximum degree 6 and 7, which run in time of 1.1893nnO(1) and 1.1970nnO(1), respectively. Our algorithms are obtained by using fast algorithms for {MIS} in low-degree graphs in a hierarchical way and making a careful analysis on the structure of bounded-degree graphs.},
